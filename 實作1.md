# MC2024 - 實作1: digitalWrite(), LED亮滅, 小實戰

## 1-1 在TinkerCAD開一個新的Circuit, 加上一個外部的LED, 並且ON (亮) 0.5秒, OFF(滅) 0.5秒, (互動1)

## 1-2 在TinkerCAD開一個新的Circuit, 分別使甪R, G, B三種顏色的LED, ALL ON (亮) 0.5秒, OFF(滅) 0.5秒, (互動2)

## 1-3 在TinkerCAD開一個新的Circuit, 分別使甪R, G, B三種顏色的LED, 讓LED ON, OFF的順序為R → G → B → G → R .... 無限循環. (互動3)

> Discussion:
> 1. Pin #3 is used to understand the output voltage of digital I/O without any load, which means we should be able to see 5V (i.e., full output voltage without voltage drop)
>
> 2. Pin #13, #11, #9 just can see around 4.02V at high state, why? The major reason why the voltage is around 4.02V, NOT 5V by the voltage drop with the parallel connection between the LED and DMM; therefore, the voltage has the significantly different!!

> Enjoy the small lab to understand the digital I/O and electrical characteristics with handson practice!!
